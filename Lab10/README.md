# Tic-tac-toe game with Reinforcement Learning player

## Tic-tac-toe game
Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

## Lab 10
The purpose of the laboratory is to use reinforcement learning to devise a tic-tac-toe player. 
I decided to implement a Model free RL and particularly the Q-learning algorithm. 

I defined the game state class and then created two players: one random and the other using Q-learning Reinforcement Learning. 

In particular, I based on the following pseudocode from the book Essentials of Methauristic:
