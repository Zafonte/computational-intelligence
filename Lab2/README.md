# Nim game with evolution strategy (+ and ,) 

## Nim Game
Is a game for two.
It starts with a series of stacks containing a certain number of elements agreed upon at the beginning by the players.

1. Players take turns removing any number of elements from any stack, from one to all, but without changing the other stacks.
2. The player who removes the last element on the playing field loses. 
3. It is not possible to skip the move.
